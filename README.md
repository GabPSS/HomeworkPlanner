# HomeworkPlanner Mobile

*See the main branch for the original .NET-based HomeworkPlanner*

This is a project to bring HomeworkPlanner multiplatform with Flutter and Dart code, porting all functions the original alpha project had while not sacrificing functionality both for desktop and mobile apps.
